                <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, 
                    and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
        
                <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We 
                    also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back 
                    into their natural environment.</p> 
        
                <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care 
                    for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a 
                    sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
